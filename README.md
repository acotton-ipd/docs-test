# jsdoc-angular_1.5-typescript
This is a simple Angular 1.5 app written in Typescript and compiled with Gulp.

To install, run `npm install` from root directory.

To compile app, run `gulp` from root directory.

To compile docs, run `jsdoc -c conf.json` from jsdoc directory.

Apologies for the thin README.  I hope to add more as this develops.
